    "\n",
    "* Statistics, the science of *data analysis*, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century. \n",
    "\n",
    "* People (scientists, goverment, health professionals, companies) collect data in order to answer certain questions. Statisticians's job is to help them extract knowledge and insights from data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Must-read for (bio)statistics students:  \n",
    "  - [_50 years of data sicence_](https://ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io/readings/Donoho15FiftyYearsDataScience.pdf), by David Donoho.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If existing software tools readily solve the problem, all the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Often statisticians need to implement their own methods, test new algorithms, or tailor classical methods to new types of data (big, streaming). \n",
    "\n",
    "* This entails at least two essential skills: **programming** and fundamental knowledge of **algorithms**. "
