## Today

* Course introduction, logistics.

* Computer languages.

* Introduction to Julia programming.

## Course material

All lecture notes are Jupyter Notebooks. It is a good idea to learn by running through the code examples. You can do this in several ways. 

### Run in Binder

Easiest way to run the Jupyter Notebooks is Binder, a free service that allows us to run Jupyter Notebooks in cloud. Simply follow the Binder link at <https://ucla-biostat-257-2021spring.github.io/schedule.html>. 

If you want the JupyterLab interface, replace the `tree` by `lab` in the URL.  

### Run locally on your own computer

1. Download and install Julia v1.6.0 from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>. On Mac, I usually use Bash command   
```bash  
sudo ln -s /Applications/Julia-1.6.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```
to create a symbolic link so `julia` command is available anywhere in the system. 

2. Git clone the course material.   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257-2021spring/ucla-biostat-257-2021spring.github.io.git
```

3. Enter the folder `ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io.git` on Terminal. 

4. Open Julia within that folder, type `]` to enter the package mode, then type  
```julia  
activate .
resolve
```
to install necessary packages. 

5. In Julia REPL, type  
```julia  
using IJulia
jupyterlab(dir = pwd())
```
to open the JupyterLab in browser or
```julia  
using IJulia
notebook(dir = pwd())
```

6. Course material is updated frequently. Remember to `git pull` to obtain the most recent material.
